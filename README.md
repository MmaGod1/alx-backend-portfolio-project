About the Project

This is my final project for the ALX Software Engineering program, marking the culmination of 12 months of intensive coursework and diverse projects. This project allows me to spread my wings and apply everything I’ve learned—leveraging the resources, technologies, and skills I’ve acquired throughout the program.
